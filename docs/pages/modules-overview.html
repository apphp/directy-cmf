<h1>Application Modules - Overview</h1>

Module is typically considered to be an add-on to the application that extends the functionality
of some parts of the system. It usually has fewer options that are configurable by the end
user, but may also handle and store of information in the database.
<br /><br />

In ApPHP Framework terms a module is a self-contained software unit (a special case
of application extension) that consists of models, views, controllers and other supporting components.
In many aspects, a module resembles to an application. The main difference is that a module cannot
be deployed alone and it must reside inside of an application.
<br /><br />

Users can access the controllers in a module like they do with normal application controllers.
Module repeats the MVC structure. Each module usually serves for a single purpose and may be easy
installed/uninstalled and moved from one application to another.
<br /><br />

You have to write special procedures to handle Modules Management, editing, installation, etc.

Examples of modules:
<ul>
    <li>Setup</li>
    <li>News</li>
    <li>Testimonials</li>
    <li>Payments</li>
    <li>etc.</li>  
</ul>
