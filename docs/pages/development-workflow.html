<h3>Typical Workflow <a class="hashlink" href="#flow">¶</a></h3>
This diagram shows a typical workflow of a ApPHP Framework application when it handls a user request:
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>
        Site visitor makes a request with the URL, ex.: http://www.yourdomain.com/index.php?url=pages/view&amp;id=1
        and the Web server handles the request by executing the bootstrap script index.php.
    </li>
    <li>
        The bootstrap script creates an Application instance and runs it:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">&lt;?php
...
A::init($config)->run();
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        The application receives a user request information from the framework component named <code>CRequest</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The application determines the requested controller and action. For this example, the controller
        is <code>pages</code>, which refers to the <code>PagesController</code> class; and the action is
        <code>view</code>, whose actual meaning is determined by the controller.        
    </li>
    <li>
        The application creates an instance of the requested controller to handle the user request.
        The controller determines that the action show refers to a method named <code>viewAction</code>
        in the controller class. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The action reads a Pages model record whose ID is 1 from the database.
    </li>
    <li>
        The action renders a view named <code>view</code> with the Pages model.
    </li>
    <li>
        The view reads and displays the variables passed from controller.
    </li>
    <li>
        The view may execute widgets.
    </li>
    <li>
        The action completes the view rendering and displays the result to the user using defined
        templates or layouts.
    </li>
</ul>
