 Installation for ApPHP Directy CMF
---------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Software requirements:
- PHP 5.0 or later version.
- PDO extension enabled

A new installation of ApPHP Directy CMF is a very straight forward process:


Step 1. Decompressing Downloaded Archive.
-------------------------------------
   Decompress the ApPHP Directy CMF script archive. The archive will create
   a directory called "PHPDCMF_xxx", where xxx represents a number of current version
   (for ex.: _201 means version number 2.0.1).


Step 2. Uploading Files.
-------------------------------------
   Upload this directory (all files and sub-directories it includes) to your
   document root (public_html, www, httpdocs etc.) or to your "directy cmf website"
   directory using FTP. Pay attention to DON'T use the capital letters in the name
   of the directories (for Linux users).

   public_html/
   or
   public_html/{directy-cmf-website directory}/
   

Step 3. Creating Database and User.
-------------------------------------
   Using your hosting Control Panel, phpMyAdmin or another tool, create new database
   and user, and assign that user to the database. Write down the database host, name of
   the database, username and password. Grant this user all needed privileges on that
   database to perform installation procedure.


Step 4. Setting Up Access Permissions.
-------------------------------------
   Check access permissions to following directories: images/ and protected/tmp/.
   Make sure that these directories are "writable" (often this means 755 access mode).


Step 5. Running Setup Wizard.
-------------------------------------
   Now you can run setup wizard. To do this, open your Internet browser and type
   in Address Bar following:

   http://{www.mydomain.com}/
   or
   http://{www.mydomain.com}/{directy-cmf-website directory}/

   If the script still not installed you will see the setup wizard starting page. 
   Follow the instructions on the screen. You will be asked to enter: database host,
   database name, username and password. Also you need to enter admin email, username
   and password, that will be used to access the administration area of the site.
   After successful installation you will see an appropriate message.


Congratulations, you now have ApPHP Directy CMF installed!
