---------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Software requirements:

- PDO extension enabled

An update of ApPHP Directy CMF is a very straight forward process:


Step 1. Backup
----------------------------------------------
   Make a full backup of your previously installed site and database before you
   start updating procedure.
   
Step 2. Saving database connection parameters.
----------------------------------------------
   Write down all data from protected/config/db.php file and then delete from
   previous installation following files:
   - protected/config/db.php
   - protected/config/main.php

   Copy all translation files from the following directory:
   - protected/messages/

Step 3. Decompressing Downloaded Archive.
-------------------------------------
   Decompress the ApPHP Directy CMF script archive. The archive will create
   a directory called "PHPDCMF_xxx", where xxx represents a number of current version
   (for ex.: _201 means version number 2.0.1).

Step 4. Uploading Files.
-------------------------------------
   Upload all files from the new archive into the directory of your current site
   (this operation will replace your old files). .

Step 5. Running Setup Wizard.
-------------------------------------
   Now you can run setup wizard. To do this, open your Internet browser and type
   in Address Bar following:

   http://{www.mydomain.com}/
   or
   http://{www.mydomain.com}/{directy-cmf directory}/

   You have to see the setup wizard starting page. Follow the instructions on the
   screen. While updating process select Update option, then enter the database connection
   parameters and database prefix that were written in protected/config/db.php (see step 2),
   also enter admin username and password, that were used in your previous installation.
   
   REMEMBER!
   ---------
   You must select Installation Type: UPDATE

Step 6. Updating complete.
-------------------------------------
   After successful updating you will get an appropriate message on the screen. 

Step 7. Placing Back Configuration Data.
-------------------------------------
   To make sure your previous accounts are working as extected, open protected/config/main.php file
   and change there some important configuration data from previous installation (see p.2):
   all 'installationKey' and 'password' parameters. Also if your previous installation used multiple
   languages, you have to replace all needed translation files with the saved from previous
   installation (see p.2).

Congratulations, you now have ApPHP Directy CMF updated!
